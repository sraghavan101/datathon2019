This repository is the submission of our team to the EPIC-Data-Challenge 2019.  We have two working code submissions:
 * **Report_Methodology_Work_Submission.ipynb**: Includes Python Analysis for Topic Clustering (LSA), Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Segmentation. Ideally run through Jupyter Notebook.
 * **R Scripts**: In the r_analytics folder, it has the relevant scripts for the Decision Tree Classifier and Poisson Regression. The main file is exploratory.R. Ideally run through RStudio. 

## Metadata:
